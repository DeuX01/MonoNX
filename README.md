# NOTICE: This application has been discontinued (and support will no longer be given to this application, use at your own risk!), all development efforts have been moved to our new emulator [Skyline](https://github.com/skyline-emu/skyline).

## MonoNX
![ILogo](Common/Images/MonoNXRound128.png)

An experimental Nintendo Switch emulator for Android!

## Usage

You will need a device with the following, minimal specifications: 
* A device running Android 5.1 or greater.
* A device using an ARM64 or a 64-bit x86 processor (preferably Quad-Core).

In order to play or use any form of Homebrew, the Application (as of now) will need you to configure Storage permissions manually; unless your copy of Android asks for permissions automatically.
